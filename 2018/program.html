				  <h2>I Sliced My SIEM: Finally Getting Value out of Your SIEM!</h2>
				  <p>SIEM history is linked to the evolution of the security industry. It has been designed initially to manage NIDS noise and then evolved to a correlation platform where outcomes of penetration test reports can be encoded.  A couple of years ago, PCI-DSS and other regulations required "log analysis" to check the compliance box and companies matured in security incident response and forensics. SIEM was the natural answer for those needs. That lead many companies to invest (heavily) into SIEM technologies.</p>
				  <p>Nowadays when you talk to executives about SIEM the most common word used is "disappointment". It represents a lot of money and benefit is very low. This talk is about sharing experienced processes that can help any organization to get value out of the SIEM. It is NOT about new "shiny tools" or "easy tricks" that will increase the bill, but test proofed manageable processes that will help you to get the most out of your SIEM.</p>

				  <h2>Weaponizing Layer 8</h2>
				  <p>Do you think users are the weakest link in the security chain? Here is some duct tape to change that, and to raise the bar for social engineers and other attackers alike. Over the last few decades, sysadmins and people working in IT have called users names and generally rolled their eyes at the antics of those allegedly lazy, stupid and uneducated people.</p>
				  <p>From PEBKAC to ID-Ten-T we have been calling them names and didn't want them on our networks. This way of destructive thinking needs an overhaul, and here are some easy tricks on how users can become the valuable asset in corporate security that indeed they should be. Finding creative solutions to existing problems have been a standard skill for red teamers, whereas those defending networks often rely on standards.</p>

				  <h2>Building a Personal Data Focused Incident Response Plan to Address Breach Notification</h2>
				  <p>The era of the data breach is upon us. In a traditional incident response investigation, the focus is often on attribution and how it was done, with an aim of quickly containing. Change needs to occur and organisations need to be able to quickly identify and understand what personal data is affected. Using the SANS six primary phases of incident response as a base, this talk will explore practical steps to rebuild the incident response plan with a personal data focus. By using and understanding Information Asset registries, data mappings and data protection impact assessments, the preparation phase can be enhanced to support personal data protection coverage in the IR plan. The goal to engage ideas and thoughts on how to improve the identification phase where detection and determination need to quickly identifies an event and subsequent incident where a potential personal data breach is occurring.</p>

				  <h2>Androzoo APK Search: A Search Service of Meta-Data Related to Android Malware</h2>
				  <p>We introduce Androzoo APK Search, an online service for querying structural information extracted from Android malware. The service is supported by an ElasticSearch cluster which can be leveraged by security experts to access a broad set of meta-data, including developer certificate information, source code elements, manifest information and antivirus labels collected for 1 million malicious applications. Androzoo APK Search can be accessed through a REST API and integrated with external projects via any HTTP clients.</p>
				  <p>Compared to other platforms, our solution supports a fast access model for retrieving the list of applications which match a specific feature (e.g., call to a given method name). Thus, our system enables the community to track indicators of compromise related to Android malware. With more than 900 fields extracted through static analysis, experts can also exploit the meta-data that we provide to devise better detection systems and prevent the propagation of malicious samples. Finally, Androzoo APK Search can be used to compute analytical metrics and create a baseline for the characterization and the classification of malware families.</p>

				  <h2>The Artificial Reality of Cyber Defense</h2>
				  <p>Security threats are growing faster than security teams and budgets while there is a huge talent shortage in security. The proliferation of data from dozens of security products in complex environments is paradoxically making it harder, not easier, for teams to detect and investigate threats. </p>
				  <p>Attackers already have an unfair advantage over the defenders in cyber-attacks, it's time for security strategies to leverage automation in detection and mitigation, restore the balance and increase our chances to come out on top in the war against cyber threats.

				  <h2>Automated, Generic System Call Hooking, and Interpretation</h2>
				  <p>When doing malware analysis, monitoring application behavior plays an essential role. To do that, one of our most used mechanisms is system call monitoring. In contrast to approaches that e.g. put breakpoints into mapped libraries, we employ a VM monitor approach that catches the SYSCALL instruction itself. When interrupting processes on such instructions, what syscall did they actually attempt to use and what do the parameters mean, as it’s all encoded in CPU registers or the stack? In order to solve that problem in the most elegant way for our users, we needed a library of signatures of all syscalls along with the data structure types and formats they use. We automated the process of harvesting system calls and data structure definitions from multiple public open-source sources and preprocessing them to produce a single data source in machine-readable form. We present the results that we keep OSS to share with the community, and demonstrate how this improves the analyst workflow.</p>

				  <h2>AppArmor for Beginners</h2>
				  <p>In this workshop, we are going to explore how AppArmor can be used to sandbox processes on Linux in practice in order to limit attack surfaces and mitigate post-exploitation scenarios. There will be a short theoretical introduction after which we will cover the following practical tasks and topics:</p>
				  <ul>
					<li>Checking AppArmor status and related kernel parameters</li>
					<li>Loading AppArmor and policies at boot time</li>
					<li>Checking the security context of running processes</li>
					<li>Creating AppArmor profiles using automated tools (aa-autodep, aa-genprof, aa-logprof, etc.)</li>
					<li>Basics of the AppArmor profile language</li>
					<li>Understanding and using common profile abstractions (/etc/apparmor.d/abstractions)</li>
					<li>Inspecting and interpreting AppArmor logs (for debugging and monitoring)</li>
					<li>Basic profile management tasks and utilities (aa-enforce, aa-complain, aa-disable, apparmor_parser, etc.)</li>
				  </ul>
				  <p>After completing these smaller exercises, we are going to write a profile for a Python web application that uses a vulnerable third-party CLI (ImageMagick/convert) tool. We will see how we can use AppArmor to immunize our web application to certain vulnerabilities in third-party components and inside the web service itself.</p>
				  <p>We are going to learn how the AppArmor userspace API (aa_change_profile and aa_change_hat) can be used to implement privilege separation, further improving the security of our application.</p>
				  <p><b>Assumed background knowledge:</b> basic understanding of Linux and system calls, basic literacy in C and Python</p>
